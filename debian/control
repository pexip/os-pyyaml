Package: python-yaml
Architecture: any
Depends: ${python:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
XB-Python-Version: ${python:Versions}
Description: YAML parser and emitter for Python
 Python-yaml is a complete YAML 1.1 parser and emitter for Python.  It can parse
 all examples from the specification. The parsing algorithm is simple enough to
 be a reference for YAML parser implementors. A simple extension API is also
 provided.  The package is built using libyaml for improved speed.

Package: python-yaml-dbg
Section: debug
Priority: extra
Architecture: any
Depends: python-yaml (= ${binary:Version}), python-dbg, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: YAML parser and emitter for Python (debug build)
 Python-yaml is a complete YAML 1.1 parser and emitter for Python.  It can parse
 all examples from the specification. The parsing algorithm is simple enough to
 be a reference for YAML parser implementors. A simple extension API is also
 provided.  The package is built using libyaml for improved speed.
 .
 This package contains the extension built for the Python debug interpreter.

Package: python3-yaml
Architecture: any
Depends: ${python3:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: YAML parser and emitter for Python3
 Python3-yaml is a complete YAML 1.1 parser and emitter for Python3.  It can
 parse all examples from the specification. The parsing algorithm is simple
 enough to be a reference for YAML parser implementors. A simple extension API
 is also provided.  The package is built using libyaml for improved speed.
