Description: YAML parser and emitter for Python3
 Python3-yaml is a complete YAML 1.1 parser and emitter for Python3.  It can
 parse all examples from the specification. The parsing algorithm is simple
 enough to be a reference for YAML parser implementors. A simple extension API
 is also provided.  The package is built using libyaml for improved speed.
